Hopefully this repositry will be of utillity for anyone trying to analyze difraction patterns.

The code in main.py allows you to do the following patern analysis:
- Analyze the change in bright area of different diffraction patterns.
- Fourier transform analysis.
- Adjustment of a bessel function.

The photos that are analyzed in this code were taken with a Nikon? camara 
And the white light that was used to visualize the diffraction patterns was genereated with 
a 1055 nm laser that in combination with a cristal.

For this reason when sepparating the channels we can see that we mostly generated light in the red channel.
Since channel red was the one with most information (most photons) this was the channel that was used to analys the patterns
